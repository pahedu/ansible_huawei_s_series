module: huawei_s_ping
short_description: Tests reachability using ping from Huawei S Series network devices
description:
- Tests reachability using ping from switch to a remote destination.
- For a general purpose network module, see the M(net_ping) module.
- For Windows targets, use the M(win_ping) module instead.
- For targets running Python, use the M(ping) module instead.
- Options -m 10 (Time in milliseconds to wait for sending next packet) 
          -n (Numeric output only)
          -t 300 (Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply) used by default.
