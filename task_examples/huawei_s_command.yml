module: huawei_s_command
version_added: "2.9"
author: "Aleksand Natov (@pahedu)"
short_description: Run commands on remote devices running Huawei S Series switches
description:
  - Sends arbitrary commands to an huawei s series node and returns the results
    read from the device. This module includes an
    argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
    before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
  - This module does not support running commands in system-view mode.
    Please use M(huawei_s_config) to configure huawei s series devices.
extends_documentation_fragment: huawei_s
notes:
  - Tested against VRP V200R010C00SPC600
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - List of commands to send to the remote huawei s series device over the
        configured provider. The resulting output from the command
        is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the
        device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass
        a dict containing I(command), I(answer) and I(prompt).
        Common answers are 'y' or "\\r" (carriage return, must be
        double quotes). See examples.
    required: true
  wait_for:
    description:
      - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the
        command. The task will wait for each condition to be true
        before moving forward. If the conditional is not true
        within the configured number of retries, the task fails.
        See examples.
    aliases: ['waitfor']
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
        I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy.  Valid
        values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value is set to C(all)
        then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
        satisfied.
    default: all
    choices: ['any', 'all']
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the
        I(wait_for) conditions.
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    default: 1
